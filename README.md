# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Used machine learning to create a "Credit Card Fraud Detection" system and linear regression to determine the proportion of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The model was then tested and trained to determine how accurately it could identify a legitimate transaction from a fraudulent one.

The dataset is take from Kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

There are increasing cases of credit card fradulent cases. So, in order to track those bulinding and system that can track those transactions is very important. With the help of this model we can track which transcations are fradulent and then can train the model to not process similar kind of transactions.
